  ## Description
  - This application uses JavaScript and Inquirer.js to dynamically create content for an HTML file from the command line interface.  It also utilizes the built in fs module to interact with the file system.  The user will be presented with a series of prompts in the commmand line, the asnwers to which will be rendered as content in a new index.html file which can then be launched in the browser.  The resulting site is intented to serve as a profile page for development teams that incluedes information about the team manager, team engineers, and team interns.

  ## Contributing
  - Developers are welcome to contribute to this project by cloning this GitHub repository to their local device.  Expanding the app's functionality to include additional roles beyond Manager, Engineer, and Intern would be likely the most helpful.  Keep in mind that each role type is defined as a class in the lib directory.  Any new classes would need to extend the intial employee class. 
  ## Tests
  - Once jest is installed on the user's device, tests can be run by entering the command npm run test in the command line.
